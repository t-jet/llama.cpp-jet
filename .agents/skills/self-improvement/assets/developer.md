# Developer improvement memory

## Improvement: Dirty worktree handoff

Condition:

- When changing code or durable planning documents in a worktree that already has uncommitted changes

Action:

- Do capture the pre-existing dirty state before edits; when the relevant files already have large unrelated diffs, identify the current task's changed paths and behavior with focused searches or line anchors, and distinguish those changes from existing user or prior-agent work in the handoff.

## Improvement: Verify untracked documentation edits

Condition:

- When editing a documentation file that is untracked in git, or when the parent documentation directory is untracked

Action:

- Do verify the changed lines, status text, line counts, and trailing-whitespace state directly with file reads or searches; run a scoped whitespace check for tracked touched paths when available, then report the path as changed. Don't rely on plain `git diff`, because it does not show untracked file content.

## Improvement: Windows server pytest path

Condition:

- When running `tools/server/tests` pytest modules on Windows from the repository root and the harness tries to launch a relative `../../../build/bin/.../llama-server.exe`

Action:

- Do rerun focused tests with `LLAMA_SERVER_BIN_PATH` set to the absolute built server executable; use `LLAMA_SERVER_TEST_SKIP_MODEL_PRELOAD=1` when the module preload fixture is unrelated to the behavior under test.

## Improvement: Mandatory startup memory order

Condition:

- When task instructions require reading self-improvement memory before any other task action

Action:

- Do make the first assistant action a tool read of the self-improvement skill and agent memory before any acknowledgement, commentary update, skill-use announcement, plan, AGENTS.md discussion, analysis, or non-memory tool use; don't send even a brief "I'll load memory first" note until that read is complete, including when the user pasted repo instructions or the note only says memory will be loaded.

## Improvement: Test-results review gate classification

Condition:

- When reviewing QA execution reports for a staged gate with FAIL, SKIP, BLOCKED, or misleading runner output

Action:

- Do classify each non-pass item as product bug, QA harness gap, environment/configuration limitation, design/test-plan mismatch, or acceptable deferred coverage; for model-backed rows, verify that the run created the required precondition metrics or logs before calling it a product bug, and update the stage implementation status with the exact next gate action.

## Improvement: Cross-reference same-day QA follow-up sessions

Condition:

- When writing a Developer test-results review on a QA execution report and a follow-up QA automation/fix session is already in the same workspace on the same day

Action:

- Do scan the test_reports directory for the next-suffix same-day report before delivering the verdict, and reference the follow-up session in the per-row review where its reusable scripts already address the FAIL/BLOCKED rows, so the Manager gate decision sees both the original blocker and the in-flight fix; don't duplicate the follow-up's work, and don't escalate the original report's blockers as Developer fix sessions when the follow-up QA session already owns the harness or script gap.

## Improvement: Replace stale test-report references

Condition:

- When updating an existing test-results review for a newer or corrected QA report

Action:

- Do replace stale report IDs, row statuses, blocker counts, and owner assignments throughout the durable review and parent implementation status before handoff.

## Improvement: Extract GGUF templates directly

Condition:

- When adding or refreshing `._test_models/*/chat_template.jinja` fixtures from a GGUF model

Action:

- Do extract `tokenizer.chat_template` from the GGUF metadata first and validate the paired `chat_template_new.jinja` by rendering both files and confirming the marked render strips back to the original output; don't copy the baseline template from a nearby model and assume it matches.

## Improvement: Windows server repro ports

Condition:

- When reproducing llama-server startup behavior on Windows with manually chosen ports

Action:

- Do check `netsh interface ipv4 show excludedportrange protocol=tcp` or use a known unreserved port range before treating bind failures as product behavior.

## Improvement: --metrics flag required for cache_checkpoint_* verification probes

Condition:

- When probing llama-server public /metrics for cache_checkpoint_* (or any cache controller) rows on a stage-10 closure contract, and the prior probe scripts or test plan steps omit --metrics from the server start command

Action:

- Do include --metrics in the Start-Process ArgumentList before launching the server; the /metrics endpoint returns 501 not_supported_error without it, and an empty or 0-row body looks like a product bug rather than a missing flag. Verify the flag is present by checking for the 501 error in the first probe run and re-launching with --metrics added before escalating to focused-substitute evidence.

## Improvement: Hybrid restore timing triage

Condition:

- When hybrid cache metrics report a hit, checkpoint admission succeeds, or public completion timing still reports `cache_n=0`

Action:

- Do trace the full handoff from checkpoint export flags and descriptor span metadata through controller restore, slot launch, and prompt processing; check request `cache_prompt`, explicit `id_slot` routing, restored token count, and checkpoint/SWA replay guards before treating the mismatch as response serialization or test-shaping only.

## Improvement: Split near-limit planning docs early

Condition:

- When creating durable implementation or planning documentation that is likely to approach the 300-line document limit

Action:

- Do split the entry into a short TOC/status file and part files before drafting the full content; don't leave an over-limit draft in the worktree while reviewing.

## Improvement: Cache metric defaults across modes

Condition:

- When adding cache metrics that are sourced from hybrid-only stats but emitted through the shared server `/metrics` path

Action:

- Do verify the metric shape for both hybrid and legacy cache modes, and use safe default values for stats fields that legacy controllers do not report.

## Improvement: Preserve local line endings in patch edits

Condition:

- When applying manual patches to files that may use CRLF or mixed line endings

Action:

- Do inspect the resulting diff and newline counts for unnecessary line-ending churn; if a formatter or shell rewrite changes unrelated lines only because of newline normalization or adds a BOM, restore your own changes for that file and reapply the patch narrowly before handoff.

## Improvement: Update indexes before mutable keys

Condition:

- When changing cache entries that are indexed by mutable fields such as use sequence, insertion sequence, namespace, token prefix, or payload residency

Action:

- Do capture the old index key and remove or update the existing index entry before mutating the field; don't add the refreshed entry without first proving the old index entry was removed.

## Improvement: Avoid parallel MSBuild targets sharing objects

Condition:

- When building multiple CMake/MSBuild targets on Windows that share generated projects or object files, especially `server-context.cpp`

Action:

- Do build those targets sequentially or use one combined build command; don't launch parallel tool calls for separate MSBuild targets that can race on `ZERO_CHECK`, `server-context.obj`, or shared object outputs, because the failure can appear as compiler errors mixed with `Permission denied` on generated object files.

## Improvement: Scope whitespace checks in dirty worktrees

Condition:

- When `git diff --check` fails in a dirty worktree because unrelated pre-existing files have whitespace errors

Action:

- Do rerun `git diff --check -- <touched paths>` for the current task files and report both the scoped result and the unrelated global failure; don't fix unrelated whitespace unless the user asked for cleanup.

## Improvement: Preserve blob line structure on Windows

Condition:

- When restoring or comparing a tracked file from a Git blob on Windows to repair a local edit or line-ending mistake

Action:

- Don't pipe `git show HEAD:path` through `Set-Content`, because PowerShell can collapse or rewrite line structure; use a binary-safe restore path or a direct Git/cmd redirect, then verify line counts and diff scope before continuing.

## Improvement: Keep planning-only tasks evidence-scoped

Condition:

- When the user explicitly asks for implementation planning or docs only and says not to implement code

Action:

- Do verify the planning deliverables with document checks such as line counts, ASCII/plain-text scans, trailing-whitespace scans, and focused diffs; don't run build, test, benchmark, coverage, security, or QA execution as evidence unless the user opens that activity.

## Improvement: Keep document index state aligned

Condition:

- When changing a durable planning document's gate state, review state, or handoff state in a documentation set that is linked from `._design_docs/document-index.md`

Action:

- Do check the matching document-index entry and update stale status or handoff wording in the same session; don't leave the index pointing to an already-corrected blocker or outdated next owner.
